Using New York city data to examine if SAT's are biased towards certain demographics.

# Are SAT's biased?
One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. In this project, I will be investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics. I will correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's important to perform well on it.

The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points. Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.

For this project I will use the following datasets published by New York city, these datasets cover demographic information and test scores. Here is the list of all the data sets used:

SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
Class size - Information on class size for each school
AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
Demographics - Demographic information for each school
School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school
